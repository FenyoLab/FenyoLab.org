        The Laboratory of Computational Proteomics headed by David Feny√∂ has as
        its research goal the detailed understanding of the dynamics of cellular
        processes. The lab applies mathematical statistical and computational
        methods to experimental design optimization, quantitative data analysis,
        and biological systems modeling. The focus of this research is proteomic
        data analysis: to develop methods and databases for protein
        identification, characterization and quantitation using mass
        spectrometry-based technologies.
