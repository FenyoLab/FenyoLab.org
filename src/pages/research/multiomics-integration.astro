      <b>Multiomics integration:</b> With the cost of deep sequencing and mass spectrometric 
      analysis decreasing rapidly, it has become feasible to characterize a large number of 
      patient samples by sequencing their genome, transcriptome, proteome, phosphoproteome 
      and metabolome. We have developed proteogenomic integration methods and applied these 
      methods across many cancers to better understand the underlying tumor biology, and to 
      find vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the treatment of patients.
