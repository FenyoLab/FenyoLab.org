Her work utilizes genome engineering techniques to build synthetic haplotypes with various combinations of potential risk SNVs and integrate them into human iPSCs. The cells containing the synthetic haplotypes will be differentiated into multiple cell types associated with Type 2 diabetes and characterized with snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and RT-qPCR."
